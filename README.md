# pltrs

pltrs "Plotters" is a high-performance Python plotting library implemented in Rust, leveraging `wgpu` for rendering.

## About

This project aims to provide a plotting library that offers improved performance and potentially more aesthetically pleasing visualizations compared to existing Python libraries. It's being developed as part of my bachelor's thesis and could potentially evolve into an open-source project.

## Features (Planned/In Progress)

*   Leverages Rust and `wgpu` for accelerated rendering.
*   (Add a couple more key features you plan to implement, e.g., "Intuitive API for plot creation," "Support for various plot types like line, scatter, and bar charts," etc.
